Introducing the Advanced AI Medic â€“ a fully autonomous emergency medical response system. This AI-driven EMS system ensures your players never bleed out alone again!
When EMS is unavailable, a paramedic NPC is dispatched to your location in an ambulance, revives you with a custom animation and prop, and then transports you to the nearest hospital.
